# Project Progress: Deepfake Defense Agent

## 1. Project Setup
- [x] Project directory structure created
- [x] Required Python packages installed (Flask, OpenCV, PyTorch, etc.)

## 2. Core Features
- [x] Flask backend initialized
- [x] File upload endpoint implemented
- [x] Media processing pipeline started

## 3. Face Blurring
- [x] Face detection and blurring for images and videos implemented
- [x] Switched from Gaussian blur to pixelation for privacy enhancement

## 4. Deepfake Detection
- [x] CNN model architecture defined in `my_model.py`
- [x] Model loading and prediction functions implemented
- [ ] Model file (`deepfake_model.pth`) integration pending (file path or existence issue to resolve)

## 5. File Management
- [x] Upload and processed folders set up
- [x] Dashboard displays processed files

## 6. Documentation
- [x] Readme with features and approach written
- [ ] Roadmap and further documentation to be added

## 7. Errors and Performance

### Errors Encountered
- **Model File Not Found:**  
  The main error encountered is a `FileNotFoundError` when attempting to load the deepfake detection model (`deepfake_model.pth`). This is due to either an incorrect file path or the absence of the model file in the specified directory. The code now includes checks and clear error messages to help identify this issue quickly.
- **File Path Issues:**  
  Windows paths require careful handling (use of raw strings or double backslashes) to avoid escape character problems.
- **No Original Media Storage:**  
  The current pipeline overwrites or processes files without storing the original, which may be a concern for traceability or auditing.

### Performance Notes
- **Face Blurring:**  
  The switch from Gaussian blur to pixelation for face regions has improved privacy by making it harder to reverse the effect. The pixelation algorithm is efficient for both images and video frames, but processing large videos may still be time-consuming.
- **Media Processing Pipeline:**  
  The pipeline handles uploads and processing reliably for images and short videos. For longer videos or high-resolution files, processing time increases, and further optimization (e.g., parallel processing or hardware acceleration) may be needed.
- **Dashboard:**  
  The dashboard loads processed files quickly for small to moderate numbers of files. Performance may degrade if the uploads/processed directory contains a large number of files; pagination or lazy loading could be considered in the future.

**Next Steps:**
- [ ] Resolve model file loading issue
- [ ] Integrate deepfake detection into upload pipeline
- [ ] Add dead pixel watermarking
- [ ] Enhance UI for dashboard
- [ ] Write unit tests and improve error handling

**Summary:**  
The project is stable for core features, with the main blocking issue being the model file loading. Once resolved, further integration and performance improvements can proceed.
